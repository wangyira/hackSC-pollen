# hackSC-pollen

### It only takes one time waiting hours in line at the USC Trader Joe's to realize that shoppers need better information about where to shop during the pandemic. The goal with Pollen was to allow shoppers to make smarter and safer decisions about where they choose to shop during the pandemic. By giving shoppers feed-back on store busy-ness and Covid safety, Pollen enables people to know a little more about the Covid safety at stores before they arrive.
