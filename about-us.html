                Amanda, Kristen, Max, and Syuen are all engineers at USC. Having met through
                the Theta Tau professional engineering society, they decided to form a team and
                take a crack at HackSC. Max, Kristen, and Syuen are all sophomores, and Amanda
                is a junior. Fun fact: this is Max and Kristen's first hackathon!</p>

                It only takes one time waiting hours in line at the USC Trader Joe's to realize that shoppers
                need better information about where to shop during the pandemic.
                The goal with Pollen was to allow shoppers to make smarter and safer decisions about where they choose 
                to shop during the pandemic. By giving shoppers feed-back on store busy-ness and Covid safety, Pollen
                enables people to know a little more about the Covid safety at stores before they arrive.
